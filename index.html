              <p>The Central Sahel and Lake Chad Basin, a sub-region in West and Central Africa that includes six countries, is at the frontline of the global climate crisis. Temperatures have increased significantly in recent decades and are projected to rise another 3-6 degrees by the end of the 21st century unless urgent action is taken.<sup>1</sup></p>  
              <p>Extreme poverty, conflict, the exploitation of natural resources and economic dependence on agriculture and pastoralism make the Sahel particularly susceptible to climate change. Rising temperatures can lead to increased conflict, displacement, and food shortages, making life difficult for already-vulnerable populations. In 2021, almost 29 million Sahelians are estimated to be in need of humanitarian assistance, 5 million more people than the previous year.<sup>2</sup></p>

              <p>Zara and her family were forced to relocate a few years ago after a severe drought in Chad’s Lac province. Since 2008, almost 800,000 people have been displaced in Chad due to climate-related disasters. Many more are using migration as an adaptation strategy.</p>
              <p>In Zara’s village, the nearest source of water is 5 kilometers away. On average, women in rural Africa walk 6 kilometers a day to collect water, though for some the distance is much longer.<sup>3</sup></p>

              <p>As she starts her journey for water, Zara passes a dried up river bed. In Chad, frequent droughts have resulted in dwindling supplies of water. Floods have also become more common since the 1990s as dry, sandy lands are unable to absorb rainfall.</p>
              <p>Since 2008, nearly 7 million people in Chad have been affected by droughts and floods.<sup>4</sup> These shocks displace communities, destroy livelihoods and undermine economic development. In 2020 alone, 20 out of 23 provinces in Chad were impacted by floods.<sup>5</sup></p>

              <p>After walking one kilometer, Zara passes farmland that has been trampled by the livestock of pastoralists forced to migrate south before crops could be harvested. Changing weather patterns and decreased availability of resources have disrupted traditional migration routes for pastoralists. More frequent and extreme weather events also increase food insecurity and malnutrition by destroying land, livestock, crops and food supplies.</p>
              <p>In 2021, more than one million people in Chad are struggling with crisis levels of food insecurity and almost three million more are estimated to be under stress. <sup>6</sup></p>

She fills her container with 15 litres of water (weighing roughly 15 kilograms) and prepares for the 5 kilometer journey back home. Zara is tired but has no time to rest as she needs to hurry back to avoid missing school.</p>

            <figcaption>– United Nations Secretary-General António Guterres</figcaption>
            <p>Climate change is an existential threat to humanity. Every day we witness its impact on the world’s most vulnerable people, such as girls like Zara, her family, and the communities of farmers and pastoralists she passes along her journey.</p>
            <p>Without ambitious action to help countries and communities adapt to climate change, the humanitarian toll will increase exponentially. Humanitarian assistance can help address the impacts of climate-related emergencies, but a massive increase in global efforts to mitigate and adapt to climate change and reduce the risk of disasters is critical to contain the suffering.</p>

        <p>Since 2008, 17.1 million people have been newly displaced in Burkina Faso,Cameroon, Chad, Mali, Niger and Nigeria. In all six countries, rapid-onset disasters such as floods and increasing violence have forced people to move, either temporarily or permanently.<sup>1</sup></p> 
        <p>Heavy rains in 2012 triggered extensive flooding, displacing millions across the region. As climate change continues to exacerbate weather variability, these types of ‘once in a century’ weather events will become more frequent.</p>

        <p>Climate shocks and high food prices have deepened people’s vulnerability and challenged their access to food across the Sahel in recent years. The Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) predicts that agricultural yields will fall by 20% per decade by the end of the 21st century in some parts of the Sahel.<sup>1</sup> These declines in crop productivity are linked to rising temperatures and changes in precipitation.</p>
        <p>In 2020, over 43 million people in the six Sahelien countries are experiencing phase 2 (stressed) food insecurity and nearly 18 million people are experiencing phase 3+ (crisis/emergency) food insecurity. These numbers are projected to increase if no mitigating action is taken.</p>
